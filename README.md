# Project-Interactive-Story

Project Description : The project is about making your own “choose your own adventure” interactive story. My partner and I will be working together on it using our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. The beginning should have three possible starts, and go through the “12 steps of a hero’s journey” throughout the story. Arrays and objects will be used to create this story.  	Before the group starts coding, we need to have a written description, a flowchart that has story choices and program logic, and a list of tasks. The program must have clickable buttons, an object to store story parts, arrays for choices and to be visually appealing to provide a good user experience. While coding, it must be well documented, be properly formatted, use camelCase, use functions for code that is repeated, perform all operations within the function and commit daily on github. Lastly, the story should follow through the “12 steps of a hero’s journey”, offer 2-3 choices per option, limit the number of encounters and have 3 unique beginnings and endings.
